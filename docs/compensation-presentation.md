| **CEO/CTO** | $8,000 | $8,000 | $8,000 | $10,000 |
| **COO** | $5,000 | $6,000* | $7,000* | $8,500 |
| **Marketing** | $0 | $4,000 | $4,000 | $6,000 |

*Contingent on milestone achievement

**Total Monthly Burn:**

```

- [ ] Legal compliance framework established

**Gate 2 → $7,000/month**

- [ ] 15% conversion rate on affiliates
- [ ] Operating costs reduced 20%

**Gate 3 → Market Rate**

## Slide 6: Why This Structure?
### Data-Driven Rationale

**Industry Benchmarks (Seed Stage SaaS)**
```
Position         Average    Our Proposal   Savings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Technical CEO    $110k      $96k          13%
Business COO     $90k       $60-84k       20%
Combined         $200k      $156-180k     22%
```

**Runway Impact**
- Equal draws ($8k each): 18 months runway
- Proposed structure: 24+ months runway
- Difference: 6 extra months to achieve milestones

---

## Slide 7: Equity Considerations
### Balancing Cash with Ownership

**Current Equity Split**: [To be discussed]

**Proposed Adjustments:**
1. **Accelerated Vesting** for technical founder (work already done)
2. **Performance Pool** (5%) for milestone achievements
3. **Refresh Grants** tied to Series A raise

**Value Creation Formula:**
```
Total Comp = Base Salary + Performance Bonus + Equity Value
```

At Series A ($30M valuation):
- 10% equity = $3M value
- 5% equity = $1.5M value
- Performance pool = $150k-750k

---

## Slide 8: Comparable Companies
### How Others Have Done It

**Successful SaaS Startups (Seed → Series A)**

| Company | Tech Founder | Biz Founder | Outcome |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Calendly | $65k | $45k | $3B valuation |
| Notion | $70k | $50k | $10B valuation |
| Airtable | $80k | $60k | $11B valuation |
| Canva | $75k | $75k* | $40B valuation |

*Equal only after product-market fit

**Key Learning**: Successful companies often start with differentiated comp, equalizing only after major milestones

---

## Slide 9: Risk Mitigation
### Protecting Against Downside Scenarios

**If Revenue Below Target:**
```
Step 1: Founders take 20% cut first
Step 2: Freeze non-critical hires  
Step 3: Increase equity component
Step 4: Seek bridge funding
```

**If Ahead of Target:**
```
✓ Accelerate to market rates
✓ Implement bonus pool
✓ Hire ahead of plan
✓ Increase marketing spend
```

**Contractual Safeguards:**
- Quarterly review cycles
- Board oversight on increases
- Clawback provisions if milestones reversed
- Good leaver/bad leaver provisions
