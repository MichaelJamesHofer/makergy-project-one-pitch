## Quick Scoring Matrix

### Step 1: Calculate Base Scores

#### Technical Score (Max 100 points)
```
Technical Skills (B1):

- Each "Need Help" = 1 point
- "Could build alone" Yes = 20 points
- Technical hours logged (A1): 
  - 1000+ hours = 30 points
  - 500-999 hours = 20 points
  - 100-499 hours = 10 points
  - <100 hours = 5 points
- Technical outputs created (A1):
  - Each checked = 3 points (20 max)

TECHNICAL TOTAL: _____ / 100
```

#### Business Score (Max 100 points)
```
Business Skills (B2):

## Step 3: Compensation Level Determination

### Compensation Formula
```
Base Rate = (Role Score × $100) + (Commitment Score × $50) + (Value Score × $30)

Adjustments:
- Past contribution 80%+ = +$2,000
- Past contribution 50-79% = +$1,000
- Past contribution 20-49% = +$500
- Financial pressure >7 = +$500
- Other income available = -$1,000
- Part-time only = -50%
```

### Compensation Bands

- CEO role qualified
- 90+ overall score
- Full-time commitment
- Critical to success
- Major past contribution

#### Tier 2: $6,000-7,999/month

## Step 4: Red Flag Analysis

### Critical Red Flags (Reconsider Any Role)
🚨 **Immediate Concerns:**

---

## Step 5: Equity Adjustment Recommendations

### Equity Formula
```
Base Equity = (Past Contribution % × 0.5) + (Future Value % × 0.5)

Where:
- Past Contribution = Hours worked / Total hours × Technical outputs / Total outputs
- Future Value = (Role Score + Commitment Score) / 200

Adjustments:
- Below market salary = +2-5% equity
- Part-time only = -50% equity
- Short-term commitment = -30% equity
- Critical skills = +2-3% equity
```

- Major past contribution (>70%)
- Full-time commitment
- Critical role (CEO/CTO)
- Long-term commitment

**Executive Level (5-20%)**

- Full-time or near full-time
- Important role (COO/VP)
- 2+ year commitment

**Early Employee (1-5%)**
